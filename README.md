## 📌 What This Tool Does

This tool allows users to type normal text and instantly convert it into small styled Unicode characters that can be copied and pasted anywhere — including social media platforms, messaging apps, and websites — without installing any fonts.

Unlike traditional fonts, this generator uses **Unicode characters**, which means the output text works universally across devices and operating systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Computers do not store letters as shapes.  
They store numbers assigned to each character.

Unicode is a global standard that assigns a unique code to every letter, symbol, and emoji.  
This generator replaces standard characters with their Unicode equivalents to create the "small text" effect.

## 🌐 Why Unicode Instead of Fonts?

Fonts require installation and are not portable.

Unicode text:
- Works everywhere
- Needs no styling support
- Is platform-independent
- Can be copied freely

That’s why small text generators rely on Unicode substitution instead of typography.
